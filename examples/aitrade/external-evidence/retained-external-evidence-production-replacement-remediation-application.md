## Applied Review

- Applied submission review ID: `0baadd1de6c02704e0ad3981f67f8cb873a1c64035b19161d9db91bda03a3ad3`

## Blockers

- 72 applied production replacement tasks still use placeholder source_uri values
- 72 applied production replacement tasks are not ready to collect

## Next Actions

- Replace remaining placeholder source URIs in the remediation owner fulfillment template and rerun this application.
- Resolve blocked applied review tasks before creating a production collection package.

## Commands

- write_applied_review: `python -m trustai external-evidence-production-replacement-remediation-apply <submission-review.json> <remediation-review.json> --applied-review-out <applied-review.json>`
- collect_after_ready_application: `python -m trustai external-evidence-production-replacement-collection-package <applied-review.json> <manifest.json> <roadmap-audit.json> --require-ready`

## Limitations

- This artifact applies reviewed owner remediation into the production replacement review stream; it does not collect evidence or prove readiness by itself.
- Collection and closure still require source snapshots, intake receipts, rebuilt manifest coverage, and a ready external-evidence readiness report.
