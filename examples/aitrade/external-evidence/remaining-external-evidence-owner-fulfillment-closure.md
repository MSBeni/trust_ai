## Blockers

- 19 reviewed tasks still use placeholder source_uri values
- 19 reviewed tasks do not have intake receipts
- 19 reviewed tasks are not covered by the rebuilt manifest

## Next Actions

- Replace placeholder owner source URIs with live authority-owned source URIs and rerun the fulfillment review.
- Collect and verify source snapshots and intake receipts for every reviewed owner task.
- Rebuild the external-evidence manifest from the verified intake receipts and rerun closure verification.

## Verification

- Source errors: 0
- Source warnings: 7
- Unmatched intakes: 0

## Limitations

- This closure report proves whether owner-reviewed evidence tasks are closed by verified intake receipts and rebuilt manifest coverage; it does not collect missing authority evidence by itself.
- A closed owner fulfillment still requires production readiness verification before external authority coverage can be claimed for the roadmap.
- Placeholder source URIs, missing intakes, invalid intakes, or missing rebuilt manifest coverage keep reviewed tasks blocked.
